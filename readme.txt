This is my first experiment with javascript.

The task I was given was as follows:

Make a page with 4 boxes.

-When you click box one, the square should change from red to green
-When you click box two, the square should disappear
-When you click box three, box two should reappear
-When you click box four, the background color of the page should toggle between white and black

This is the solution I came up with.
